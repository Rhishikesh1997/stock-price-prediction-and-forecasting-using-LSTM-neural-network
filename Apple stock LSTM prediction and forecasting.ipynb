    "Time series analysis refers to the analysis of change in the trend of the data over a period of time. Time series analysis has a variety of applications. One such application is the prediction of the future value of an item based on its past values. Future stock price prediction is probably the best example of such an application.\n",

    "A long short-term memory network (LSTM) is one of the most commonly used neural networks for time series analysis. The ability of LSTM to remember previous information makes it ideal for such tasks. we saw how we can use LSTM for the Apple stock price prediction. I would suggest that you download stocks of some other organization like Google or Microsoft from Yahoo Finance and see if your algorithm is able to capture the trends."

    "A long short-term memory network (LSTM) is one of the most commonly used neural networks for time series analysis. The ability of LSTM to remember previous information makes it ideal for such tasks. we saw how we can use LSTM for the Apple stock price prediction. I would suggest that you download stocks of some other organization like Google or Microsoft from Yahoo Finance and see if your algorithm is able to capture the trends."
